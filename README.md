A list of hardware and software that I use.

**Monitor**  
[ASUS ROG Swift PG278Q](https://www.asus.com/Monitors/ROG_SWIFT_PG278Q/)
27" 2560x1440p 144hz G-Sync TN Panel  
PC: Stock DisplayPort Cable; Mac: Cable Matters USB-C to DisplayPort Cable  
>*I've been rocking this as my main monitor since it was first released in late 2014. It was the first monitor that could do 1440p@144hz with G-Sync. Overall it's been great and mostly trouble-free. I still only run a single-monitor configuration but have multiple systems which is a headache with this since it only has one video input. I really need a multi-monitor setup with a gaming monitor and a work/everything else monitor.*

**Keyboard**  
[MK Night Typist](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4295)  
Cherry MX Silent Red switches  
>*A nice little basic full size backlit mechanical keyboard. I like the simple one-color white backlit keys instead of rainbow RGB. Silent Red switches are nice and quiet but it makes me want to try every type of keyboard switch now. I have a feeling I may like Browns or Clears even better.*

**Mouse**  
[Glorious Model O](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-model-o-white)  
Matte White, Black Ascended Cord  
>*One of the best lightweight ambidextrous mice available. It could use a few improvements but great overall performance for the $50 USD price.*

**Mousepad**  
[SteelSeries QcK](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-series?size=l)  
Large (previously known as the QcK+)  
>*My go-to mouse pad for many, many years. Very low profile, no rough edges, pretty sturdy rubber base with a medium speed cloth surface weave. Not the most durable mousepad out there but it's a great value at $15 USD.*

**Mouse Bungee**  
[Razer Mouse Bungee V2](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice-accessories/razer-mouse-bungee-v2/RC21-01210100-R3M1)  
>*I liked the slimmer look of this bungee over other competitors. It works fine but could be a little bit heavier and the bottom mouse cord clips could be a little smaller or even adjustable to tightly grip all types of cords with different diameters.*
