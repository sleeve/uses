A list of hardware and software that I use.

**Keyboard**  
[MK Night Typist](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4295)  
Cherry MX Silent Red switches  
*A nice little basic full size backlit mechanical keyboard. I like the simple one-color white backlit keys instead of rainbow RGB. Silent Red switches are nice and quiet but it makes me want to try every type of keyboard switch now. I have a feeling I may like Browns or Clears even better.*

**Mouse**  
[Glorious Model O](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-model-o-white)  
Matte White, Black Ascended Cord  
*One of the best lightweight ambidextrous mice available. It could use a few improvements but overall it has great performance for the $50 USD price.*
